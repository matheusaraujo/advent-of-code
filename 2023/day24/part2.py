# for a given hailstone n with position (x, y, z) and velocity (dx, dy, dz)
# and the rock with initial position (x0, y0, z0) and velocity (dx0, dy0, dz0)
# they will collide at Tn:
# { x0 + Tn * dx0 = x + Tn * dx
# { y0 + Tn * dy0 = y + Tn * yx
# { z0 + Tn * dz0 = z + Tn * zx
# therefore:
# { x + Tn * dx - x0 - dx0 * Tn = 0
# { y + Tn * dy - y0 - dy0 * Tn = 0
# { z + Tn * dz - z0 - dz0 * Tn = 0
# for each hailstone we have 3 equations and 7 variables
#   Tn and rock position and velocity (6 variables)
# so if we have 3 hailstone, we have 9 equations and 9 variables
# (3 for rock initial position, 3 for rock velocity and 3 Tn, 1 for each hailstone)
# it's enough to do the maths
# instead of manually implement the system solver, it was used `sympy`
# after all, it's christmas
