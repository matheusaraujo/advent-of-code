Follow these steps to add support for a new language.

## Adding Support for a New Language in 10 Steps

1. **Register the Language in `lib/aoc/langs.sh`**  
   Update the following sections of the script:
   - Add the language to the `available_languages` array.
   - Define its file extensions in the `language_extensions` array.
   - Add any alternative names or abbreviations in the `language_aliases` array.

2. **Create the Main Program File**  
   - Add `lib/lang/main.lang`.  
     This file should:
     - Read input from **standard input (_stdin_)**.
     - Print the puzzle solution to **standard output (_stdout_)**.

3. **Set Up a Run Script**  
   - Add `lib/lang/run.sh`.  
     This script should define how to execute `main.lang`.

4. **Add a Code Check Script**  
   - Add `lib/lang/check.sh`.  
     Use this script to perform code linting or other validation checks.

5. **Add a Code Format Script**  
   - Add `lib/lang/format.sh`.  
     This script should handle code formatting for the language.

6. **Add Puzzle Example Files**  
   - Create `part1.lang` and `part2.lang` files in `2000/day00`.  
     These serve as example solutions for the language.

7. **Update the Docker Configuration**  
   - Modify the `Dockerfile` to install any necessary dependencies for the new language.

8. **Update the Development Environment**  
   - Modify `devcontainer.json` to include relevant extensions and settings for the new language.

9. **Update CI/CD Pipelines**  
   - Adjust `.github/workflows` as needed to include support for the new language in the project's pipelines.

10. **Test and Have Fun!**  
    - Verify your setup by solving a sample puzzle, such as _2015 - Day 1_!
